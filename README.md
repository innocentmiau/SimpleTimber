# SimpleTimber
A simple minecraft plugin that allows to chop down trees instantly.

## A very simple Timber plugin, just add on the server and it will work right away with nothing to config with:
- [x] Timber allows to chop down an entire tree from just breaking the lowest log block.
- [x] This won't happen if the player is sneaking.

## Please let me know if something is missing on it.
I tried to code it as simple and working as possible, below is my discord details for ideas or bug fixes(support):
> My discord: **Miau#0307** (This may change, read below for server reason).

> My discord server: https://discord.gg/Yg3Dbs2uVG - Can be used for just chatting or a way to find me in case my discord discriminator(tag, the #) changes because of discord nitro or just me swapping it.)

> Let me know if there's any bug, since plugin is coded to allow all the versions, this may cause some bug. (I tested it myself on 1.9.4 version and 1.19.3 and it worked fine but I can't test every single scenario myself).

### Good for simple SMPs that require such plugins to not overload server.
*If you need this plugin in a older version, please do message me and I will update it.*

DO NOT copy/download my code and release as your own.
